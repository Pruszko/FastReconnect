# Fast Reconnect

Sometimes, for some users, game permanently loses connection during
battle (and all tanks stops responding). It can even happen in hangar.

Because there are no buttons for disconnect in such scenario, either
you have to:

- wait 40 seconds timeout in battle or
- restart a game (~20 seconds depending on PC)

... to again see Login Screen and reconnect.

This mod allows you to **instantly kick you to Login Screen** skipping
above delays to help you reconnect MUCH faster (from there you
only have to login and wait for map loading).

Depending on PC, you can come back into battle in
**less that 10 seconds** since noticing a connection loss.

## Features

- **CTRL+K** shortcut to **instantly disconnect you** from anywhere to Login Screen

## How to use

- When you notice permanent connection loss, hit **Ctrl+K** (like
  Control Kick) shortcut. This will **quickly kick you to Login Screen**.
- Login again to rejoin a battle.

By this, you don't have to restart a game or wait for timeout
to rejoin a battle as fast as possible.

## Note

Shortcut **CTRL+K** works **ANYWHERE** except for replays.

Use it wisely.
